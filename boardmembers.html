                       <h5>Bio</h5>
                       <p> Sarah Celotto is a wife, a mother of 3 and works
                          at her local church. She was born in Ireland and
                          moved to Connecticut with her family when she was
                          7 years old. She was educated in a catholic school
                          and continued her high school education at
                          Kylemore Abbey Boarding School in County Galway,
                          Ireland. She came back to the U.S. and attended
                          Albertus Magnus College where she pursued a degree
                          in Business and Economics with a concentration in
                          Management. From there she married and got a
                          Masters in Elementary Education from University of
                          New Haven.

                          Sarah has had various positions over the years
                          ranging from a manager at a fitness studio to a
                          para educator for special needs students.
                          Ultimately she decided to stay home and raise her
                          children and during that time she delved into
                          volunteering at local charity organizations as
                          well as the PTO at her children's schools.

                          When one of her children came out as part of the
                          LGBTQ community, Sarah jumped into educating
                          herself. She attended meetings and read books and
                          articles so that she could fully be there for her
                          child. In doing this, Sarah realized the need for
                          education, communication and creating spaces where
                          youth and adults could be their true authentic
                          selves without feeling judged. She started ALEX
                          not only for her child but for all those who have
                          felt unseen, unloved and unsupported. She hopes
                          this organization will help create a world where
                          we can live together with no judgement or hate but
                          instead acceptance and love.</p>

                          Sara was born and raised in California, the
                          daughter of a Los Californianos member, a non-
                          profit organization whose members have direct
                          blood-line descent from individuals of Hispanic
                          ancestry who were residents of California before
                          it was part of the United States. She graduated
                          from Northern Arizona University in 1999 with a
                          Bachelor's degree in Anthropology. Her move to
                          Connecticut was precipitated by a job offer for
                          her husband, Talbot. They have two amazing
                          children, one in high school and one just starting
                          college. Sara works as an administrative assistant
                          at a local non-profit. In her spare time(when she
                          has some!), she enjoys reading, outdoor biking and
                          cards or dominos with friends. She participated in
                          the Closer to Free Ride for the second time this
                          year, honoring her father's memory and battle with
                          cancer."My involvement with ALEX started with a
                          desire to counter some of the hate and anger in
                          our society today. In contributing to an
                          organization where acceptance, love, equality and
                          a desire for change are the main focus I hope to
                          help shift one small part of our world toward
                          those ideals.'</p>

                       <h5>Bio</h5>
                       <p> After losing dozens of friends and his partner in
                          1993, Scott struggled to find motivation and
                          purpose. Corporate life was no longer satisfying,
                          but he knew it was possible to create good
                          business that also gives back to the community.

                          Recognizing that maximizing affinity with gay
                          consumers required highly specialized marketing
                          communications strategies, Scott founded SPI
                          Marketing in 1996. Drawing on the lessons he
                          learned from 16 years of corporate work and 10
                          years of community volunteerism, Scott created SPI
                          for the purpose of linking community with commerce
                          in meaningful and sustainable ways. The LGBTQIA
                          community is largely self-funded, and he wanted to
                          help entrepreneurs gain access to the resources
                          they needed to succeed.

                          Active in community service, Scott has served on
                          the Board of Governors of Bread & Roses, a
                          Connecticut AIDS service organization; speaker
                          with the Stonewall Speakers Bureau, an LGBTQIA
                          educational outreach organization. He is a
                          founding board member of Honoring Our Journey, a
                          mens spiritual group. Scott has been listed in
                          OUT100 and Instinct Men of the Year and has been
                          awarded recognition by several LGBTQ+ service
                          organizations he has supported.

                          Scott and SPI provide expertise to a variety of
                          other community organizations and businesses.
                          Scott lives with his husband on the Connecticut
                          coastline.</p>
